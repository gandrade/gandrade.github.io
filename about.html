## About
I'm a _Java_, _Groovy_ and _Node.js_ developer, studying _functional programming languages_, like _Elixir_ and trying to change my _mindset_ as a _Software Developer_. I have to confess that in the beginning, it's quite hard. I think that the golden rule for that is to give a step back and throw away all legacy mindset that you have and learn from the ground. Apart from that, I'm really interested in philosophy stuff and behaviour. This interest came when I started to read some books from *Mário Sérgio Cortella*. His books are awesome and I really recommend it.  

Speaking in behaviour, if you have some interest in personality assessments, I did one some months ago and I really recommend it. The assessment is completely free and you could repeat it each six months to compare earlier results. Please, take a look on my [personality assessment](https://www.talentoday.com/users/gustavoandrade/personality).
